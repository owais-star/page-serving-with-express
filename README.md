https://pageserving.herokuapp.com/

i have deployed this app to the heroku server and i am using express static to serve the react app and it is running fine in local server but after the deployment to heroku the "/"
request is not working for the rendering of app through express.static, while the rest of four methods i have created for https://pageserving.herokuapp.com/profile route are working 
fine please suggest me something to make it work on the deployed server.
